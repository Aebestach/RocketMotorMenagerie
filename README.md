This part pack is designed to provide interesting rocket engines and diversify your propulsion options.

Features
----
Currently the mod includes the following parts:

|RMM Engine|Real Analogue||Wiki Link|
|---|---|---|
|RM-122T 'Rainier' Cryogenic Rocket Engine|Space Transportation Main Engine||

You will notice that they run on a variety of fuels. These fuels provide advantages and disadvantages compared to stock Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer, having different efficiencies, thrust ranges and storage volumes. You can check out my [roadmap](https://trello.com/b/22sCynUl/engine-pack-roadmap) of engines that **potentially** could be added.
